Neural Network-based classifier

This is an example that using the classifier for classification. We used the species level (or gene level) profile of D1 with the marker species (or marker genes) for training and the species level (or gene level) profile of D2 with these marker species (or marker genes) for testing. 'MarkerSpecies_D1_model.h5' and 'MarkerGenes_D1_model.h5'are our trained models. Users can also train the models themselves.   

Requirements: Python environment.

Useage: once Python is installed, 'Test.py' can be implemented.
