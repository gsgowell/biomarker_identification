Neural Network-based classifier

This is an example that using the classifier for classification. The samples of D1 with the biomarkers were used for training. Meanwhile, the samples of D2 with the biomarkers were used for testing. Users can also train the models themselves.   

Requirements: Python environment.

Useage: once Python is installed, 'Test.py' can be implemented.
